🚲 Bike Maintenance Prediction System

🔑 Features

Database Integration: Data is stored and fetched from a PostgreSQL database.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, cleans features, and creates additional engineered features such as:

vibration_per_km = average vibration per km since last maintenance

rain_ratio = ratio of rainy rides to days since last serviced

Machine Learning Model: Trains a predictive model to classify whether a bike needs maintenance (needs_maintenance = 1) or not (0).

Modular Design: Easily extendable with new features or different ML algorithms.

📊 Tech Stack

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, psycopg2, matplotlib, seaborn)

PostgreSQL (bike data storage)

Jupyter Notebook (for model development & visualization)

⚙️ How It Works

Connects to PostgreSQL and loads bike feature data.

Drops rows with missing maintenance labels.

Performs feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy.

Trains and evaluates ML models to predict bike maintenance needs.

🚀 Future Scope

Real-time prediction with a FastAPI

Integration into a bike-sharing dashboard.

Automatic alerts when a bike is due for servicing.
